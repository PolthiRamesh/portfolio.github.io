    <p><B>ABSTRACT:</B>
        Brain Tumor segmentation is one of the most crucial and arduous tasks in the field of 
medical image processing as a human-assisted manual classification can result in in- accurate 
prediction and diagnosis. Moreover, it becomes a tedious task when there is a large amount of 
data present to be processed manually. Brain tumors have diversified appearance and there is a 
similarity between tumor and normal tissues and thus the extraction of tumor regions from 
images becomes complicated. In this thesis work, we developed a model to extract brain tumor 
from 2D Magnetic Resonance brain Images (MRI) by Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm 
which was followed by both traditional classifiers and deep learning methods. The experimental 
study was carried on a real- time dataset with diverse tumor sizes, locations, shapes, and different 
image intensities. In traditional classifier part, we applied six traditional classifiers namelySupport Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Among these 
classifiers, SVM provided the best result. Afterwards, we moved on to Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) which shows an improvement in performance over the traditional classifiers.
We compared the result of the traditional classifiers with the result of CNN. We also compared
our result with the existing research works in terms of detection and achieved better results than 
many state-of-the-art methods. For the traditional classifier part, we achieved an accuracy of 
92.42% which was obtained by Support Vector Machine and CNN gave an accuracy of
97.87%
