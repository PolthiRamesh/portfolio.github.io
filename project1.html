        <p><B>DESCRIPTION:</B> main aim of the project is to control robotic arm by the movements of the robotic glove to reduce human effort in working.</p>
        <p><B>ABSTRACT:</B>
            A Robotic Arm controlled by a Robotic Glove using Flex Sensor is a promising development in the field of robotics that offers a natural and intuitive way for humans to control complex machinery. This system consists of a glove worn by the human operator and a robotic arm that mimics the movement of the operator's hand. The glove is equipped with flex sensors that detect the movement of the fingers and hand and transmit this data to the robotic arm. The robotic arm then replicates the motion of the operator's hand in real-time, allowing for precise control of the machinery.
            One of the key advantages of this system is its ease of use. The flex sensors on the glove provide a reliable and cost-effective way to capture the motion of the operator's hand, making it an attractive option for a wide range of industries. Additionally, the system is designed to be intuitive, allowing operators to control complex machinery with minimal training. This is particularly important in industries such as manufacturing and medical procedures, where operators must be able to perform intricate tasks with high precision.
            Another advantage of the Robotic Arm controlled by a Robotic Glove using Flex Sensor is its potential for use in remote control of machinery. The system can be used to control machinery from a distance, allowing operators to perform tasks in hazardous or hard-to-reach locations. This could be particularly useful in industries such as mining, oil and gas, and construction, where workers often operate in dangerous environments.
            Overall, a Robotic Arm controlled by a Robotic Glove using Flex Sensor is a promising development in the field of robotics. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with machines, making it easier and more intuitive for humans to control complex machinery. With further development and refinement, this technology could have a significant impact on a wide range of industries, from manufacturing to healthcare, and beyond.
